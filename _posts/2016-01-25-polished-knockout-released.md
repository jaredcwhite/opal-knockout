As a long-time fan of the [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) view library, I got this crazy idea a while back to see if I could build an [Opal](http://opalrb.org) library that makes use of Knockout under the hood yet facilites an incredibly easy-to-use DSL for creating Ruby view models. 

Today, I'm very excited to release the first fruits of that idea, **Polished: Knockout**. Polished is a new set of loosely-coupled front-end framework components built around the idea that adding real-world, modular Opal code to a standard Rails/Ruby web app should be ridiculously simple. The first Polished component to be released is the Knockout gem. By using this gem, you can leverage the amazing power of Knockout.js in your projects, all the while writing beautiful Ruby code and avoiding Javascript entirely.

Check out the [Getting Started tutorial](/knockout-rb/getting-started/), and [join the project on GitHub](https://github.com/polished-rb/knockout-rb)!
